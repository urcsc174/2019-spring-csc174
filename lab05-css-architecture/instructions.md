# In-class Lab 5: CSS Architecture

*Due: Monday, February 18, 2019 (today)* 

The goal of this exercise is to practice arranging CSS into a useful structure (architecture).

NOTE: this is an individual assignment.  Everyone turns-in their own work on Blackboard.

## Prep

Download and unzip the CSS file: [lab05-starter-files.zip](lab05-starter-files.zip)

## Requirements

The provided CSS file has 170 styles on 1,180 lines.  Each style is in alphabetical order, which is not useful.  Your task is to rearrange the styles to demonstrate your understanding of CSS architecture.

*NOTE: you are **not** being asked to read or edit the styles themselves!  You just have to MOVE the styles (the selectors along with their declarations) into logical groups, separated by comment-blocks*

- [ ] Edit the file **lab05.css** - apply a CSS architecture.  Use any published technique or invent your own that uses comment-blocks to define specific areas within the file.
- [ ] The CSS must continue to pass [the W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [ ] At the top of the CSS file write the following in comments:
  - Your name
  - The CSS organization technique(s) you used.  Or if you made your own variation of a technique then describe it.
  - Provide an outline of the CSS structure - the order of things, from a high-level ...like a table of contents

Note: you can re-arrange the contents of this one file.  You can break the contents into multiple files.  It's up to you, but whatever you do needs to make sense from a CSS management standpoint.

## Submit the Assignment

To get credit for your work, upload your CSS file(s) to Blackboard, in the assignment: **In-class Lab 5: CSS Architecture**
