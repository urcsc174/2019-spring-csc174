# In-class Lab 3: Markdown and Information Architecture

*Due: Wednesday, February 6, 2019 (today)* 

There are two goals of this exercise: (#1) practice putting together content into a meaningful structure (information architecture), and (#2) practice using "markdown."

For this exercise you need to gather sets of content from three separate and very different sources.  

- **Recommended:** go to Wikipedia.  Locate *three* different topics that interest you. 
- Even though the sources need to be very different, think of some *common thread* - something they *do* have in common.  (Be creative.)  E.g. cars, trains, and airplanes …they're all modes of transportation

Regarding *markdown*, here are some references:

- [Wikipedia: Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)


- [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- You can also Google things like "markdown syntax" or "markdown images" - there are lots of people who have written about it


Also, it's not required but you can find free WYSIWYG markdown editors.  The professor uses: [Typora](https://typora.io/).  

Also also, you can create an `.md` file directly in GitHub, online, in your repository.  While in a repository in GitHub, just click the "Create new file" button.  Be sure to name it with the .md extension.  

## Requirements

- Create a markdown document with the filename **readme.md**

- At the top of the markdown document, create *and style* heading information:
  - Title (what this document is about - the "domain" …the thing the three separate topics have in common)

  - Your name

  - The assignment name

  - Date
    …stuff like that

*Hint: you need to create a structure with headings, paragraphs and other elements that shows commonality and/or differences as appropriate.  (Yes - this is the hard part of this exercise!)*

- Write a short paragraph (100 words or so) describing in a little more detail something about the three topics and what they have in common.  

- In the rest of this markdown document, you need to create a good structure using the principles of information architecture. All told, you should have a document with around 500-700 words or so.  (I'm not going to count the words, but you should be in the ballpark.) There should be several headings, sub-headings, stuff like that.

- What you'll be graded on is your understanding of Information Architecture through your demonstration of the following...

  - There should be a clear **ontology**
  - The **taxonomy** should be consistant
  - The **choreography** (in this case, because it's one long scrolly document you just need to be concerned about order)


When you're done...

- Create a submission in Blackboard, in the **In-class Lab 3** assignment and upload your **readme.md** file
  - If you wrote your markdown file directly in GitHub, submit the link in Blackboard
