# Assignment 2: "Flash" Website
*Due: today - Monday, February 4, 2019 (75 minutes)*

**The goal** of this assignment is to work as a team to combine three students' initial personal websites into one cohesive website during the time allotted.

**The purpose** of this assignment is to demonstrate how working with a team of web developers is better than working alone.

Note: in this exercise, the term "flash" does *not* refer to Adobe Flash; rather the idea of *sudden*

## Requirements

The final product of this exercise must meet the following requirements:

- [ ] Three students' initial personal websites must be combined to create a **three page website plus an index page** (four web pages, total)<br>Note: you do *not* have to use your team's own Initial Personal Websites!  
- [ ] There needs to be **links back to the original** Assignment 1 websites in some appropriate place(s)
- [ ] There must be **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements from each webpage to external "include" files


- [ ] The navigation element must **indicate which is the current page** (you'll have to use a PHP or JS solution to insert the a *class* on the appropriate menu item)
- [ ] The HTML, CSS and JS code, files and file system must be clean and follow **industry best practices and standards**

### Installation

- [ ] **The team must install the website** on the class web server (not Digital Scholar) using the following web server credentials, below.

Note: each team will use the same FTP account. Be careful *not* to disturb other teams' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment02@csc174.org
FTP Password: [ask the prof]
```
- [ ] When you FTP-in to the account, create a folder using the name of your **city-team** and place your website in there

## Submit the Assignment

To get credit for your work:

- ONE of you must submit a link to your website in Blackboard, in the assignment: **Assignment 2: "Flash" Website**
- Along with your link write in the **Write Submission** area (*not* the comments box):<br>- **Your city-team name**<br>- A list of **everyone's name** in your team (including your own), and...<br>- Next to everyone's name **indicate everyone's role on the team** (IA, designer, or coder)

# Suggested Workflow

Here are suggestions on how to complete this assignment by dividing roles and responsibilities

- The **Coder** should setup the repository and add the other team members as contributors, then the entire team should sync the repository to their localhosts
- The **IA** should gather the content from the other team members and massage all the content together into three new HTML pages.  (Yes - that'll take a lot of copying & pasting.)  
- As soon as the webpages are available, the **Designer** should stitch together the CSS.
- While the Designer is working on the CSS, the **IA** should create an index for the website.
- While the IA and the Designer is working on the website, the **Coder** should install the Current Page Menu Highlighter.
- Late in the process, the **Coder** needs to frack the HTML into PHP includes where appropriate.  Be careful, changing files names will trip-up the other team members!  Have them stop and wait until the site is re-configured, then have everyone re-sync so they can continue work.
- Last step: the **Coder** needs to upload the finished website on the class web server (not Digital Scholar)
- One of the team members (any) needs to create a submission in Blackboard on behalf of the team.
