# Course Syllabus: CSC 174 - Advanced Front-end Web Design and Development

"Front-end" is an industry term that refers to the focus on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which differentiates this course from the formal programming courses. Topics include Information Architecture, visual design, use of client libraries (mostly JS), and asset management strategies; we will also cover Content Management Systems and introduce web databases using PHP and MySQL.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Participation**<br>There are in-class exercises for which students are graded as *participation*.  Many of the exercises are pass/fail.  Each counts equally toward the total of 30%. | **30%**                   |
| **Midterm Practical (project)**<br>There is one project (basically, a big assignment) near the middle of the semester which tests students' abilities at that point in the semester. | **15%**                   |
| **Assignments**<br>There are assignments at various times in the semester the discretion of the instructor.  Each assignment counts equally toward the total of 55%<br><br>**Final Assignment**<br>There is one assignment offered at the end of the semester that allows students to increase their grade by doing an extra assignment. If the student chooses to do it, it will count toward their Assignment grade, i.e., included in the 55% calculation | **55%**                   |

## Assignments and In-class Exercises

This course uses a combined lecture/lab format.  Assignments and in-class exercises are introduced and discussed during the same classroom time as the lecture, and time is set aside for students to work and get help on them.

### In-class Exercises

On the day when an in-class exercise is assigned, students must complete them in-class, on that day.  

- In-class exercises that are not turned-in on-time (by the end of class time) receive a substantially lowered grade.  
- Students who provide a University-approved excuse (documented illness; documented sports activity; documented job interview; et cetera) get an *exemption* for that particular exercise.  

### Assignments

Assignments (previously referred to as "labs") are made available via [Slack](#communication) during the lectures and each is given a due date.  Assignments and can be completed in the dedicated lab time (in the classroom) or independently on the student's own Internet-connected computer (Mac or PC).  

### Technical Help

There are three ways students can get help on assignments.

- From the TAs during dedicated work time in the lecture/lab classroom
- During the Professor's virtual office hours in [Slack](#communication)


### Due Dates

For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown near the top of the lab instructions. To avoid a zero grade, each must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before its due date.  

### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be graded unless a *prior* arrangement has been made with one of the TAs or the professor to give you an **extension by one or two days** based on the discretion of the TA or Professor.  Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the professor. The grade for assignments not turned-in on time with no prior arrangement for an extension will be zero.

### Second chances

Unlike CSC 170 **every assignment is graded once** and gets averaged-in to the overall grade.  There are no second chances per se.  However, there are a lot more smaller assignments in CSC 174 therefore a bad grade on any assignment can be averaged-way relatively easily by simply doing better on other assignments.

## Texts and Materials

Because of the dynamic nature of the web development industry, this course does not use a textbook. All information required to pass the course comes from the lectures so attendance is mandatory.  

**Important:** Because attendence is not graded the student is on thier honor to go to all the lectures.  If a student is unable to attend a lecture, it is the student's responsibility to get the information missed from another student. (The TAs and the Professor will not re-teach a lecture.) 

Students' inability to complete assignments or projects (i.e. exams) because of a missed lecture is not a valid excuse.

### Personal Computer and Software

In addition to the hosted Web service, provided by the University, students will need to use a personal computer (PC or Mac) with specific capabilities and software installed:

- A code editor
- FTP software
- An updated, popular web browser
- An Internet connection
- A localhost "web stack" consisting of Apache, PHP, and MySQL software

If a student does not have a personal computer with these capabilities, the University provides open labs at various locations on campus that they can use.  Those computers have all the required capabilities and software installed and they are supported by University IT.  

For reference: during lectures the professor will be using

- a **Macbook** and **Windows PC** (alternatively) 
- a code editor: **Sublime Text, version 3** ([www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3))
- FTP software: **Cyberduck** (for Mac, [cyberduck.io](https://cyberduck.io/)) and **WinSCP** (for PC, [winscp.net/eng/download.php](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php))
- a localhost, built by: **MAMP** (for Mac, [mamp.info/en](https://www.mamp.info/en/)) and **WampServer** (for PC, [wampserver.com/en](http://www.wampserver.com/en/))
- Demonstrations during the lectures will be done using **Google Chrome**.

## Academic Honesty

Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person’s work as one’s own, or the attempt “to blur the line between one’s own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source.” ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003,](http://wpacouncil.org/node/9)). More specifically for CSC 174, **computer code (HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript) submitted for grading, that was copied from another source in part or whole without acknowledgment is plagiarism**.  To protect yourself, in the programming world, citations of sources may be placed in the "code comments" of submitted files.

### Industry Practices

Note that in the web development industry it is common for professional developers to inspect, i.e. look and study someone else's code for the purposes of inspiration.  In fact, that's how good developers get better, and in the industry, it's encouraged.  But here in academia there is a line between inspection for inspiration versus plagiarism.  Students must be very careful to not copy other students' code and submit it as their own without proper attribution.  In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University’s rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty.  For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)

## Academic Assistance and Accommodations

Please know that this classroom respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds and abilities. Students are invited to talk with the professor about any concern or situation that affects their ability to complete their academic work successfully. Useful resources for all students include the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, located at **1-154 Dewey Hall** on the River Campus; telephone: **(585) 275-9049** or email <cetl@rochester.edu>

## Schedule

This [schedule (linked here)](schedule.md) is subject to modification throughout the semester.  Always check with the professor to answer questions about the schedule.
