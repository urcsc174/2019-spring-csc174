# In-class Exercise 12: Editable HTML Tables

*Due: Monday, April 15, 2019 (today)*

The purpose of this lab assignment is to find a solution to enable the ability to read and write to a MySQL table using an *editable* HTML form.

- GOOGLE: **php mysql html table edit** ...or something like that, and peruse the tutorials for one that looks well-written and easy to implement.
  - Beware of solutions that use PHP mysql_ commands instead of mysqli_ (...with the **i**)
  - Feel free to add search terms like "**ajax**"

## Requirements

Using your localhost, install a solution that has these abilities:

- [ ] Pulls data from a MySQL table and **displays** it in an HTML table
- [ ] Ability to **add** new records to the table using an HTML form *in* the table
- [ ] Ability to **delete** records from the table, selectively
- [ ] Ability to **edit/update** existing records in the table, "inline"

Also, do *not* use the example we already did back in October (Four DB Functions).  That was too plain.
