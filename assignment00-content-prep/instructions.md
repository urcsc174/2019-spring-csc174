# Assignment 0: Content Prep
*Due: Wednesday, January 23, 2019*

For the next CSC 174 class, **have content prepared** to create a quick webpage that we'll mess around with later.  (You only need the content ready to go.  We'll work on putting it together next week.)

## Requirements

- [ ] Your name, your major, basic information about yourself you want to share
- [ ] A digital photo of yourself (or a photo that represents something you like)
- [ ] At least 500 words about the following
  - Job(s) you've held, if any (can be anything: work-study; internships; co-ops; et cetera)
  - Courses you're taking or have taken ...or pretty much anything about your academic career
  - Other things about you (or information about your country/area of origin; or anything else you would like to share)
- [ ] Write the content in four distinct sections 
  - Suggestion: create the four sections as paragraphs - at least four but can be more; each one should be between 75 and 150 words or so
  - Suggestion: write it like a story - can be a timeline; or some kind of progression (beginning, middle, end); or some other logical sequence (e.g. courses you've taken grouped by easiest, harder, hardest)
  - Do *not* create lists, headings, or other types of elements - just sentences arranged in paragraphs
  - Keep the image (the photo of yourself) as a separate file - do *not* embed it in your document

Look at [the professor's example (ZIP)](media/example.zip) to get a feel for what's required.  Notice, in the Word document there are no headings nor lists.  It's just plain text.  And notice the image file is not web-ready - it's way too large.  (That's okay.  We'll fix that next week.)
