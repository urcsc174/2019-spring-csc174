# In-class Lab 6: Readability and Typography

*Due: Wednesday, February 27, 2019 (today)* 

In this exercise you will take existing content and demonstrate your ability to increase readability and legibility by applying the design principles covered in class. 

This is an **individual in-class lab**.  You will *not* be working as a team on this one.

## Step 1: Copy an Assignment

- [ ] EVERYONE in GitHub **fork** a city-team's Assignment 2, 3, or 4 website ([see here for links to the assignment repositories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17nncaY3FWkgq2HEqK6IWAsyNsav34Jo4e-Vj1pwoXEQ/edit#gid=0))
  - [ ] Pick one that has a relatively decent layout but **readability factors that you think you can improve** (it's okay to select one of your own websites)
  - [ ] You do not have to add anyone as collaborator; you'll be working on this assignment alone
  - [ ] Sync your repository to your localhost
- [ ] Pick *one* of the sub-pages in the website and rip-out (delete) the other subpages and the index file
- [ ] Rename the one remaining webpage to **index.php**
- [ ] In the index.php file, remove contents (inner HTML) from the **nav** element from the webpage (leave the nav element there)
- [ ] Inside the nav element, place a **link to the original website** (the Assignment 2, 3, or 4)
  - Do not use the URL as the link text!
- [ ] Add a **readme.md** file to the repository

## Step 2: Improve the Web Page

The key to this exercise is to *not* randomly apply styles like we did in CSC 170, rather **use reasons and rationale** to apply just the right styles in just the right ways to make the webpage more legible and readable.  

### Requirements

Using CSS, you need to make these improvements.

- [ ] Improve the **legibility and readability** of this webpage using CSS

  - [ ] Refer to the [CRAP principles](../08-principles-of-page-design1/principles-of-page-design1.pdf)
  - [ ] Apply the [Principles of Readability](../11-readability-and-typography/readability.pdf)
  - [ ] Install two new (or different) [custom fonts to improve the visual aspects](../11-readability-and-typography/typography.pdf) of the webpage

  - Beware!  Make sure the fonts pair well and actually make sense considering the content
  - Focus on legibility and readability

*Note: you do not have to change or fix the layout of this webpage (but if you break it, you need to fix it!)*

#### Document your Decisions

- [ ] As you complete the requirements above, you need to: **write in the readme.md file to explain the rationale for each set of styles you write.**  
  - Relate each style to the things we covered in class 
  - Explain not just what you did, but **why **
  - Keep it short!  One or two short sentences - or just a bulleted list - is all you need to do.

Examples:

- explain the typefaces you chose...

```
## Typography
I picked these typefaces, monsarrat and finociario, because they pair well (accoding to Google Fonts) portray a mood of... (and so on)
```


- explain styles that improves readability...

```
## Readability
I added padding to these elements to move the content away from the border, increasing readability of the section... (and so on)
```

...and write-up other things you did.

*Note: it's never a good idea to choose a typeface based on its name alone. Also never say that you chose a typeface or style because you "like it."*

## Step 3: Submit the Assignment

- [ ] The website must be installed on the class web server with a folder name in the pattern of first-initial, last name, e.g. **rkostin**, (or you can make it the same as your URID), and put your website in there
  - Note: the root of the website needs to be the folder you create.  (e.g. **rkostin**)  Do *not* put the website within another sub-folder within the root.  I.e. do not create an "lab06" folder.

### Web Server Credentials

Everyone will use the same FTP account in this class so be careful when you're working on the web server!  Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment06@csc174.org
FTP Password: [search the #announcements channel in Slack]
```

*Notice that the username is different from last time*
